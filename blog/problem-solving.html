      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        From the time I stared Javascript, I feel uncomfortable to declare a variable.
        When trying to understand and solve a problem, I am hesitating what sould I do. 
        last week, I couldn't start JS variables and object in replit because I am not familier with making variable name and when should I do it.
        So I was searching how wo declare variable and how to make good variable's name.
        and I got used to seeing many examples.
        and then  I used Pseudocode and followed step by step. It was clear the question and my brain.      
        To be honest, I am still hestating make some variable in the function, but I first thought about what to do step by step, wrote the Pseudocode, and started to try even if it failed.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2> elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        IT IS  A 'SUPER FIZZ BUZZ'.
        In sprint 3 , I spent time to study Loop because I didn't understand it.
        Now, I am very familier with loop. Therefore, the first mission of this problem could be solved easily.
        However, in the second mission, it was to arrange several together and give conditions. I didn't know the rules for giving multiple arrays together, so I googled. Then, after writing the induced code, the problem was solved step by step.
        Last week, I learned the basics of JavaScript and learned how to solve problems, and when I solved the problems, I felt more systematic and less time.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>How confident do you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes?</h2>
      <br/>
      <h3> Pseudocode [6/10]</h3>
      <p>I understand how uesful Pseudocode. but I not sure I can use it if it hase not some instuctions like replit
      Otherwise, if have some instuction, I am confident it!
      </p>
      <h3>Trying something [10/10]</h3>
      <p> 
        I am 100% confident trying something. Sometimes I tried something, I'd broken mt coding..and I made it again
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method [8/10]</h3>
      <p>
        Normally, I use it all the time. I explained by myself and keep thinking "so Waht is next?
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages [ 3/10 ] </h3>
      <p>
        I tried it but I didn't understand the error messege. I was coding something and get error messege about not defined somthing.
        that time, I thought "okay! it is errow and then? what should i do? not enough explain!!!!!"
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging [ 6/10 ] </h3>
      <p>
        When I need to check if working or not, I use Console.log. Unfortunately I don't have idea that it isn't worng in console.log but not working my cording.
        A little bit confusing that time.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help.[ 3/ 10]</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes I used it. but I am working in the morning and then I am on in the afternoon.
        when I want to ask something, they are off. so it is difficult for me. 
        Because it is difficult to set the time, I sometimes leave a message and check it the next day.
         This is not used very often as it takes time to troubleshoot.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peer for help. [8/10]</h3>
      <p>
        They're in the same situation as me, so they don't answer the exact problem, but they give useful tips.
        And I often use this method because I feel more comfortable being in the same situation.

      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection [5/10]</h3>
      <p>
        This method gives time to reflect on the problems that arise in the process. But it doesn't work well when you run into the next problem.
      </p>
