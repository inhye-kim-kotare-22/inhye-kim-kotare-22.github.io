      <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
      <blockquote>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        When I leave the academy, I want to do a little more work on creating websites for restaurants. Previously, I worked in a restaurant business and majored in food and nutrition. I want to develop a site or app for a restaurant company that can be well publicized in connection with my previous major.<br>
        In the future, I want to open a small dessert cafe, sell desserts and coffee online, and develop a delivery app for office workers.<br>
        But in the short term, I would like to learn more skills by joining a company that develops apps for restaurants.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        In Sprint 2, my strength for me was that I worked systematically. And the weakness was the lack of basic knowledge about coding, so I was worried about whether I could do it well.
        In addition, now, thinking about the mindset learned through core learning, I am trying to have a little more leeway about my worries, and I am trying to overcome the worries that come from shortcomings. It is natural to worry a lot while doing boot camp, but I think I will be able to overcome it well because I did not waste 5 weeks of time.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </h2>
      <p>
        Of course it's a presentation. English is my second language. So there were many difficulties while studying, and I am worried that there will be. Actually, I don't have to worry about teaming up and coding. Because I will do everything I can so as not to harm other people, and I am ready to invest more time than others while always reflecting on my shortcomings. However, it is difficult to improve English in a short time, and there is a fear that I will ruin the assignments that have been made difficult with my team members.
        But to become a web developer, presentation is essential, and I think you have to overcome this well. I think I will make a lot of mistakes, but in school, even if I make mistakes, I think it’s understandable because it’s a learning process.
        I think that the current mistakes and tensions are nothing for practical purposes.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to develop more about language communication through boot camp. Speaking of language communication, speaking English is also improving, but I would like to be able to approach New Zealand culture a little more. As each country has its own style, I would like to learn more about team activities and communication methods in New Zealand.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>When you learn new things in a new environment, you sometimes lose your confidence. Especially in my case, it seems to be the case as it is a second language.<br>
         When asking a question or talking, there is a fear of “can I say this?”
        In times like these, I hope that you will give me a lot of encouragement and opportunities to be more challenging.
        In fact, during the foundation period and during team meetings, Naomi and her team members gave a lot of encouragement. They listened to me when I was talking and encouraged each other that we could do it. So I gained confidence, and I was able to do it comfortably when participating in team meetings. These encouragements made me positive, and I think I started studying coding more during my worrying time.
        The bootcamp team is also looking forward to this. Even if I'm a little slow, if you wait, I'm ready to show you that I don't disappoint.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I will not spend too much time solving the problem using different methods of solving the problem. For example, I will decide how much time I will spend solving this problem myself. And after that time, I'll ask my peers or the facilities team.
        <br>Also, by understanding the problem accurately and making it clear what to do in sequence, I will not waste time and keep my appointment time with my teammates.

    <h1>foundation Learning Plan</h1>
    <br/>

        <h2>About my planning</h2>
        <p>My long term goal is that be a competent Software Developer. Also, to be a growing developer, 
          I will continue to study the rapidly changing IT field in New Zealand.
          <br>I am proud of organised skill with multi task and managed with under pressure and time.
          I agree developer should manage time to collaborate with other peoples. Also, Learning new education takes highly pressure.
          <br>I see many people give up their new challenges because of pressures. 
          <br>So I believe it is important managing with under pressure. 
          While studying at the Dec-academy, I was pressed for time, 
          <br>but I believe that I will overcome it well by making use of my strengths.
          <br> I was difficult  how to searching some problem in my language as well. 
           <br>I think this is a limitation caused by my lack of basic knowledge about coding, 
           <br>so I think that if I spend time on building up basic knowledge step by step, I can overcome my weakness.
           <br>On the other side, I am lack of searching skill. English is not my first language but
           <br>also  I was difficult  how to searching some problem in my language as well. 
           <br>I think this is a limitation caused by my lack of basic knowledge about coding, 
           <br>so I think that if I spend time on building up basic knowledge step by step, I can overcome my weakness.
           As a developer, I would like to see developed more development on my thoughts and attitudes about how to solve problems. to be more specific, 
           <br>I would like to see how to work with other team when I get into the real work
           <br><br>
           I think it is important to set priorities in order to manage the work load. In particular, if I am faced with a large amount of work, 
           <br>I may become emotionally exhausted and may exceed the specified time while wondering where to start. In that case, I will think about 
           <br>what I can do first and what I should do first, and then I will do it step by step.
           <br>In this program, for 5 weeks, 70% of the focus will be on technical learning, 
           <br>and the remaining 30% will be on the core part. And during the boot camp, 
           <br>I will fill in the core parts that we learn in practice through cooperation with other.
           <br><br>
           Currently, I work from 8 am to 2 pm on weekdays, but I prioritize the foundation course first.
           <br>Before the boot camp starts, I have an appointment with my current employer that I will quit my job 
           <br>so that I can be in touch with my teammates anytime, anywhere and get help from the facilitator team.
           <br>Also, my sister is already working as a developer, so when I need help, 
           <br>I will ask the facilitation team and my sister, and I will support my time and effort to get help.
