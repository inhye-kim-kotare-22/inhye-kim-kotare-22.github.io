        <h2>About my planning</h2>
        <p>My long term goal is that be a competent Software Developer. Also, to be a growing developer, 
          I will continue to study the rapidly changing IT field in New Zealand.
          <br>I am proud of organised skill with multi task and managed with under pressure and time.
          I agree developer should manage time to collaborate with other peoples. Also, Learning new education takes highly pressure.
          <br>I see many people give up their new challenges because of pressures. 
          <br>So I believe it is important managing with under pressure. 
          While studying at the Dec-academy, I was pressed for time, 
          <br>but I believe that I will overcome it well by making use of my strengths.
          <br> I was difficult  how to searching some problem in my language as well. 
           <br>I think this is a limitation caused by my lack of basic knowledge about coding, 
           <br>so I think that if I spend time on building up basic knowledge step by step, I can overcome my weakness.
           <br>On the other side, I am lack of searching skill. English is not my first language but
           <br>also  I was difficult  how to searching some problem in my language as well. 
           <br>I think this is a limitation caused by my lack of basic knowledge about coding, 
           <br>so I think that if I spend time on building up basic knowledge step by step, I can overcome my weakness.
           As a developer, I would like to see developed more development on my thoughts and attitudes about how to solve problems. to be more specific, 
           <br>I would like to see how to work with other team when I get into the real work
           <br><br>
           I think it is important to set priorities in order to manage the work load. In particular, if I am faced with a large amount of work, 
           <br>I may become emotionally exhausted and may exceed the specified time while wondering where to start. In that case, I will think about 
           <br>what I can do first and what I should do first, and then I will do it step by step.
           <br>In this program, for 5 weeks, 70% of the focus will be on technical learning, 
           <br>and the remaining 30% will be on the core part. And during the boot camp, 
           <br>I will fill in the core parts that we learn in practice through cooperation with other.
           <br><br>
           Currently, I work from 8 am to 2 pm on weekdays, but I prioritize the foundation course first.
           <br>Before the boot camp starts, I have an appointment with my current employer that I will quit my job 
           <br>so that I can be in touch with my teammates anytime, anywhere and get help from the facilitator team.
           <br>Also, my sister is already working as a developer, so when I need help, 
           <br>I will ask the facilitation team and my sister, and I will support my time and effort to get help.
