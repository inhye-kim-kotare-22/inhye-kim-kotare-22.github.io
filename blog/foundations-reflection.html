      <h1>foundation Reflection</h1>
      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>I did a lot of self-reflection through core learning. Because I have seen many aspects of my self that I have not been aware of.<br>
      First, I thoughjt I was already doung well, but it wasn't as good asd I thought it would be. So I looked for a way to meditate and give rest to the brain through core learning, and I found out that my figure become clearer and more relaxed after practiciung it.<br/>
      Second, I thought about whether I am a suitable person as a seb developer. Before starting the course, I only thought that I could become a seb developer. However, through coire learning , I started to think about whether I had the tendency to become a seb developer.<br>
      As I thought a lot, the process og learning as a developer become more interesting, and I came to think that I wanted to live as a developer rather than just a job.<br>
      Third, as I learned about the importance oif EQ, I became more confident about myself. Actually, I value my emotions and think a lot about other people;s felling.<br>
      I thought this charater was not good. because I was drawn to other people and didn;t look nice and smart.<br>
      However, while studing, I realized that there are times in life where I have to collaborate with other people, and there are thimes when EQ's ability ius more important for that.<br>
      So I will respect my charater a little more and become a web developer with soft skills by making this appearance more abvantageous.
    </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        I am not sure if I understand it well, but I think the rilke of values, empathy and self-awareness are key points when working with other.
        <br> Web developement doesn't seem to be =somthing you can do alone, and it requires cooperation with other people. In that case, I think these three roles are important. I think it is important to know yourself well and to increase that value empathizing with others. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        While I was doing tech learning, I got stressful. But whoile I was doing core learning, I could control my mind. So I COULD DO THIS FOUNDATION CORSE.
        <br> Especially I love learning mindset, because I could see deeply and I could keep mind that had had before start Dev-academy.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Surprisinglty, I had a hard time with myy plans. Before starting this course, I  only thought that I could to express it im writing. So I spent a lot of time thinking about it.<br>
        But I still don't know. there is fear of what will happen after the course is over, and there is also pressure to do well, so I worry about whether it will go as planned.<br>
        I will think a little more and come up with a plan. And it will make you feel confident that things are going well as planned. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        This seems to be for practicing the real field. When I get a job at real company, I may be embarressed about how you communicate and collaboration with people in practice rather than being able to code.<br>
        So I think we spent a lot of time on core train them to become more professional Web developer.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>
        I don't think so at all. I graduated from university in Korea. At that time, I learned about the knowledge and skills of a specialized field, but when I was into in real job, it was very defficult.<br>
        i was under a lot of stress about how to work with my teammates and with what attitude to work, and I only thought that I wanted to quit the Job.<br>
        In the first week, while creating a blog, there was a time when i thought about core learning as a waste of time. But I learned each week. I realized the importance of it, and I also saw that I was gradually adding more time to this core learning.<br>
        This course gave me an oppotynity to think about whether I really want to become a Web develpoer before getting a Job, and it was an oppotunity to learn in advance about coding.and how to work with people when I go into real job. I felt that this school was really different from other school.
