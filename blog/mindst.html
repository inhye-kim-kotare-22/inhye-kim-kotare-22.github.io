      <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
      <br>
      <br/>
      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>
          Q. How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?
        </h3>
        <br/>
          <p>
            A. Neuroplasticity is the ability of brain cells to change in response to changes in behavior, regardless of age. If we understand this, we can overcome the age limit.
            If you keep learning, your brain will recognize what you've learned and change accordingly, regardless of your age.
          </p>
        <h3>
          Q. How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit?
        </h3>
        <br/>
         <p>
           A. I will be exposed to many stimuli to participate in the principles of neuroplasticity.
           For example, learning a new language or doing creative activities to approach new things.
           Currently, learning computer language is my part.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Q. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
         </h3>
         <br/>
          <p>
            There are a lot of ways to increase a neuroplasticity. In this bolg, I will recommend my ways what I tried.<br/>
            <br/><p>1) Write a daily.</p>
             <p>
               I keep a diary every night at night.
              According to Dr. Chinichian, like muscle-building, neuroplasticity needs downtime in order to do its work properly.
              <br> Managers should embed and enforce a “close the day” ritual that prioritizes reflection and gratitude for small wins.</p> 
             </p><br/>
            <p>2) Eating Almond.</p>
            <p>
              I always eat 7piece of Almond for few years.<br/>
              Vitamin D and magnesium are top priorities if you want to promote neuroplasticity. 
            </p>
            <br/><p>3) Play Sudoku Game!</p>
            <p>
              I downloaded a Sudoku Game in Phone and I do it when I face to some stuck moment.
              Sudoku is a game that engages the brain throughout the puzzle-solving process, it helps to teach the brain to think quicker. 
              <br>The more you play it, the quicker your thinking skills will be.
            </p>
            <br><p>4) Use the “wrong” hand</p>
            <p>
              Sometimes I am used to play this game with my family.
              <br/>Non-dominant hand exercises are excellent for forming new neural pathways, as well as strengthening the connectivity between existing neurons.

      <h2>Mindset</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Q. What Mindset is and why it is relevant with us.</h3>
        <br/>
         <p>
          Mindset is like this in the dictionary meaning.<br>
          Mindset is an "established set of attitudes, esp. regarded as typical of a particular group's social or cultural values; the outlook, philosophy, or values of a person; frame of mind, attitude, disposition."<br>
          I don't know how to accurately explain the way of mindset, but I think the way of mindset is the thoughts and values that come from people's experiences and education.<br>
          Do you know this word? :It was up to you to make up your mind. Like this, Our mindset influences our behavior.
         </p>
         <h3>Q. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
         <br/>
         <p>
          As I did my research on mindset, I came to know that there are two kinds of mindset. It is a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.<br>
          A fixed mindset is the belief that a mindset is already formed at a young age and does not change. This already limits the value of a person and prevents further development.<br>
          On the other hand, growth mindset is believing that you can continue to grow. This keeps the challenge going.<br>
          I am a person with a growth mindset, but sometimes I think, “I am this kind of person.”<br>
          Saying  "I am this kind of person" was an attitude of having a limited mindset without realizing it.
         </p>
         <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
         <br/>
         <p>
          I had already made up my mind before I even started learning.
          With this mindset of "I can do it"<br>
          And when I want to give up while learning, I will keep a positive mindset while thinking about my future.
         </p>

        <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Learning a new language is stimulating the brain. And when faced with a problem, I will not stop. Now, when I don't understand, I google and use a website that is explained in writing. However, we will also use a method to stimulate the brain more using video. 
            <br>And these efforts will always accompany the idea that I will become a web developer.
