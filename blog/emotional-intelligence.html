      <h1>What is EQ?</h1>
      <p>Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, <br/>
        <br/>overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h1>What is IQ?</h1>
      <p>IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a measure of your ability to reason and solve problems. 
        <br/>It essentially reflects how well you did on a specific test as compared to other people of your age group.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h1>what is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h1>
      <p>IQ is an inborn ability and general Intelligence. <br/>
      EQ is learned and improved ability and Emotional Intelligence.</p><br/><br/>
      <h1>Why EQ is important</h1>
      <p>The world is to live with other people. That's why EQ is so important. <br>
        Living with people who have a different opinion from me is stressful . <br
        >We also need to live in harmony with each other. However, if you lack EQ, <br>
        you can face various problems because you cannot live with other people.<br>
        For example, it may be difficult to make friends, or you may be stressed when it comes to work because you and other people think differently.</p><br/>

      <p>As I worked, I understood the importance of EQ. It was empathy.
        When I was in my early 20s, in order to achieve my goals, only my opinions were important.<br>
         But as positions change in the workplace, achieving goals is also important. 
         <br>But I've come to realize that empathizing and managing emotions among employees produces better results.</p>
