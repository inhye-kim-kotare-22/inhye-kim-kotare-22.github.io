        <h2>About my identity and values</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, the most important values ​​for me are cooperation, patience, and consideration.
          <br> I started working as chef in New Zealand and am currently working as a manager for the same company.
          <br> When I first learned to cook, I had no basic knowledge and mistook a lot of time, but thanks to my seniors waiting and caring for me so that I could improve, six years later, I was able to work as a manager.
          <br>With this experience, I tried to wait and understand even if beginner employees made a mistake.
          <br>We made the highest income one of branches.<br><br>
          The employees who worked with me have been promoted to managers of another new store 
          <br>and are living a more stable life at the moment.<br>
          I believe that life cannot be lived alone. 
          <br>It takes someone's patience and someone's consideration, but I think we can all work together and live well.
          
          <br>My favorite sentence is <strong> "If you do it alone, you can do a little, but if you do it together, you can do a lot."</strong><br>
          The sentence is from Helen Keller<br>
          
          Even now, with the help of team members studying together and the support team,
          <br> I am following the foundation's progress. I am still not good enough to become 
          <br>a developer, but with your help, I hope that I can become a great developer.
            <br><br>
           My strengths are a challenging attitude and good organizational structure. I think these advantages can help me <br/>
           improve my skills while studying as a web developer and systematically approach what the company and customers want. 
           <br>But sometimes I focused only on the idea of ​​getting things done successfully, while there were times when I couldn't understand other people's minds.<br>
            Last year I worked as a manager at a Japanese restaurant at the airport. <br>
            The store had over $10,000 in sales per day. I always thought of increasing sales, and didn't care about the problems between the employees.<br>
            Because they were busy, dissatisfaction piled up with each other, and suddenly two or three employees complained that they could not work together.
            At that time, I was a little perplexed. I thought everything was perfect, but it wasn't.
            So I invited the staff to my house for dinner and had time to talk to each other. After talking to each other,
            <br> everything worked out, and the tea mwork was good while we were working.
            
            I think it's important to have enough conversations when doing things we have to do together. 
            <br>Because we have different ideas, we can understand each other if we talk about what we think and how we feel. 
            <br>I think that better infrastructure can be created because of that.</p>
