        <h2>About my identity and values</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, the most important values ​​for me are cooperation, patience, and consideration.
          <br> I started working as chef in New Zealand and am currently working as a manager for the same company.
          <br> When I first learned to cook, I had no basic knowledge and mistook a lot of time, but thanks to my seniors waiting and caring for me so that I could improve, six years later, I was able to work as a manager.
          <br>With this experience, I tried to wait and understand even if beginner employees made a mistake.
          <br>We made the highest income one of branches.<br><br>
          The employees who worked with me have been promoted to managers of another new store 
          <br>and are living a more stable life at the moment.<br>
          I believe that life cannot be lived alone. 
          <br>It takes someone's patience and someone's consideration, but I think we can all work together and live well.
          
          <br>My favorite sentence is <strong> "If you do it alone, you can do a little, but if you do it together, you can do a lot."</strong><br>
          The sentence is from Helen Keller<br>
          
          Even now, with the help of team members studying together and the support team,
          <br> I am following the foundation's progress. I am still not good enough to become 
          <br>a developer, but with your help, I hope that I can become a great developer.
